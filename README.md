# Library-management-System

A web-based Library Management System developed by me using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL. This system helps manage library operations, enabling admins to manage books and students to lend books efficiently. The system is backed by a SQL database to store all records securely.

# Features:

Admin Login: Secure admin login to manage library operations. <br>
User Registration & Login: New users (students) can register and log in to access the library system. <br>
Book Management: Admins can add new books to the library's collection. <br>
Allotment of Books: Admins can allot books to students and maintain records of book issuances. <br>
Lending System: All users can lend books from the library. <br>
SQL Database Integration: Maintains records of users, books, and transactions in a SQL database for secure data management. <br>
<br>
# Technologies Used: 
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap CSS <br>
